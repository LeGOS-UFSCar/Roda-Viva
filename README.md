About
The Roda Viva corpus comprises transcribed and rewritten interviews, transformed into journalistic texts sourced from the TV Cultura show Roda Viva. Although our ultimate goal is to establish a
multimodal corpus with two subcorpora (one for speech and the other for the transcription), at this moment, only the textual dataset is currently available. The textual corpus is available in two versions. 
Version 0.1, comprises texts acquired directly from the Roda Viva portal. These texts have undergone a cleaning process, during which elements such as links and icons found on the original pages of each in terview were eliminated. The primary goal was to meticulously preserve the textual content of the interviews, ensuring the comprehensive retention of their original form.
The second version, 0.2, of the corpus arose due to the need to remove the interventions made by the transcribers in the original texts. These interventions, which will be elaborated upon in the subsequent section, involved the insertion of textual information not present in the interview videos.
